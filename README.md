# VeGA-RX
We introduce VeGA-RX, conditioned on dual semantic descriptors (SMILES + SMARTS-RX), and VeGA-SCX, which integrates topological guidance (SMILES + Scaffold + SMARTS-RX). Both models efficiently explore chemical space but with distinct profiles: VeGA-SCX prioritizes structural discipline, while VeGA-RX maximizes generative freedom.
